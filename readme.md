# Authentication Boilerplate
This repository provides the essential codebase to set up a secure website with authentication capabilities.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into two main folders:

## Backend
The backend folder holds the server-side code responsible for managing authentication and handling data interactions.

## Frontend
In the frontend folder, you'll find the client-side code responsible for creating the user interface and interacting with the server for authentication purposes.

# Getting Started
To utilize this boilerplate for your project, follow these steps:

## Backend Setup:

Follow the instructions provided in the respective README to set up the server, configure authentication parameters, and handle data operations.

## Frontend Setup:
Head to the frontend folder.
Refer to the README within this folder for guidance on configuring the client-side application, customizing the user interface, and integrating authentication features.

# Running both backend and frontend server
1) Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2) Run `npm run dev` to start both frontend and backend

# Additional Information
For more detailed information about each component, refer to the README files located in the backend and frontend folders.
